This repository will be used to add track of all AdventOfCode that I do every year

URL: https://adventofcode.com/

In order to run the code for each day, you need to create a folder for each day, create a index.ts file for the solution and a puzze-input.txt and puzzle-example.txt file with the input and the first example for the day. Then, in order to execute the code, use the following command:

```bash
cd day<day>
npx tsx .
```
